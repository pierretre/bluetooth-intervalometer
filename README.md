# bluetooth intervalometer

This project is based on Arduino and Android. The goal is to create an intervalometer compatible with all cameras that can be programmed from a distant smartphone via bluetooth.
The app must allow the user to set the shutter speed, the time between two pictures and the total number of pictures he wants to take.

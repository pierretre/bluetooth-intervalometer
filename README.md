# bluetooth intervalometer

This project is based on Arduino and Android. The goal is to create an intervalometer compatible with all cameras that can be programmed from a distant smartphone.
In order to send data from the phone to the arduino, I'm using a simple Android app that connects to the bluetooth module of the arduino.
